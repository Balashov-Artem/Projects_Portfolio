      <description>Design of stiffened composite panels with account process technological deformation.
 Goals Introduction Analytic model FEA Experimental model Source code Conclusion
  Goals The main purpose if to make an analytic model to considering technological deflected mode (Stress-Strain condition, or SSC) while design an integral structure. (By intagral means structure, that made from 2 or more parts and formed at the same time).
First step objectives: * Investigation influence of structural parameters integral construction on technological deflected mode in terms of stringer set panel.</description>
