Hi, my name is Artem, and this is my portfolio. It was made not only for perform my abilities or skills but to shere interesting projects I have a pleasure to take a part in. I will fill this blog with projects I made as soon as I find time for it.

Now, for short about myself. I'm Ukrainian. In 2017 I've finished highest education at National Aerospace University in Ukraine and move to China to take a Master degree here. Currently I'm studying in Ukrainian NAU 'KhAI' and Chinese HIT at the same time. Also, I work in my lab here almost every day. 

My major is 'design and construction air- and spacecraft from composite materials'. Sounds indefinite and what does it mean. Actually, I have a deep enough knowledge of basic and advance working principle of air- and spacecraft contractions, and also I have an experience in composite science. And my second major, here in China, is general mechanical engineering, specifically precision machining.

P.S.
This portfolio is under construction currently, because I make it by myself and my knowledge in web design is poor (I'm engineer, anyway) and my free time is limited, so now please excuse me if some parts of the text are not translated yet and if you have displaying errors. I'm working on it.
